# Invidiually-Unique Pokémon Colors (+ Improved Shiny Colors) for Pokémon HeartGold

[(Example video)](https://imgur.com/a/Xb3QwaE)

This HeartGold hack aims to make it so each individual Pokémon has a slight color variation based on its personality value. This is inspired by a [similar feature](https://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/9846/images/pikacolors.jpg) from the Pokémon Stadium games that does just this but based on the Pokémon's nickname. The ROM hack [Pokémon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal) implements a very similar feature based on IV values. This implementation performs a hue shift on the Pokémon's palette on load.

If you would like to use this in your own hacks, please feel free to do so!


## Improved Shiny Colors

Some Pokémon have shiny colors that are very close to their non-shiny colors, or at least close enough that the simple hue shift performed by this hack may make a normal Pokémon look shiny. To remedy this, many Pokémon have been given revamped shiny colors. In additon, the opportunity has been taken to revamp Pokémon that seem to have obviously "bad" shiny palettes even if there's no ambiguity issue.

List of changed Pokémon (so far):

![Pichu](ShinyChanges/pichu_shiny.png) ![Pikachu](ShinyChanges/pikachu_shiny.png) ![Raichu](ShinyChanges/raichu_shiny.png)

**Pichu, Pikachu, Raichu** - Tried to make visually distinct instead of the slight orange tint. A bit of a gradient from pale yellow to pale orange throughout the evolutionary line.

![Nidoqueen](ShinyChanges/nidoqueen_shiny.png)

**Nidoqueen** - Colors made to look like Nidoking, which matches the pattern set by all other members of the Nidoran lines.

![Meowth](ShinyChanges/meowth_shiny.png) ![Persian](ShinyChanges/persian_shiny.png)

**Meowth, Persian** - Mint green to complement vanilla shiny Meowth's pink, and with a silver coin and ears, respectively. *(The image data of Meowth's sprite has also been tweaked.)*

![Abra](ShinyChanges/abra_shiny.png) ![Kadabra](ShinyChanges/kadabra_shiny.png)

**Abra, Kadabra** - More pink instead of brown to match, and create a gradient towards, shiny Alakazam.

![Seel](ShinyChanges/seel_shiny.png) ![Dewgong](ShinyChanges/dewgong_shiny.png)

**Seel, Dewgong** - Made to look more visibly gold. The color used in the highlight in Seel's eyes (added in HG/SS) has been fixed for the shiny palette (Game Freak forgot to change the color, so it just stayed the default "unused magenta" color).

![Haunter](ShinyChanges/haunter_shiny.png) ![Gengar](ShinyChanges/gengar_shiny.png)

![Normal Gengar](ShinyChanges/gengar_normal.png)

**Haunter, Gengar** - Tried to make a sensible gradient from Gastly to Mega Gengar (purple -> white with blue highlights). Normal Gengar has been also modified to be like its [anime palette](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/8/8a/Morty_Gengar.png).

![Scyther](ShinyChanges/scyther_shiny.png)

**Scyther** - Made to be red-orange, which makes shiny Scyther and Scizor effectively be a loose swap of their normal colors.

![Elekid](ShinyChanges/elekid_shiny.png) ![Electabuzz](ShinyChanges/electabuzz_shiny.png) ![Electivire](ShinyChanges/electivire_shiny.png)

**Elekid, Electabuzz, Electivire** - Light blue, with Elekid being slightly more Cyan. Electivire has gold tips.

![Munchlax](ShinyChanges/munchlax_shiny.png) ![Snorlax](ShinyChanges/snorlax_shiny.png)

**Munchlax, Snorlax** - Like a brown bear.

![Articuno](ShinyChanges/articuno_shiny.png)

**Articuno** - Lavender.

![Zapdos](ShinyChanges/zapdos_shiny.png)

**Zapdos** - Brown.

![Sunkern](ShinyChanges/sunkern_shiny.png) ![Sunflora](ShinyChanges/sunflora_shiny.png)

**Sunkern, Sunflora** - Purple and a more blueish green, resembling a [purple sunflower](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rqiFQLLiL._AC_SL1203_.jpg).

![Espeon](ShinyChanges/espeon_shiny.png)

**Espeon** - Less overly saturated.

![Leafeon](ShinyChanges/leafeon_shiny.png)

**Leafeon** - Fall colors, inspired by [various](https://aminoapps.com/c/shiny-pokemon-amino/page/blog/do-you-wish-shiny-leafeon-and-shiny-glaceon-was-batter/7eJV_e2nUPuEW5ZJBD4wELq7qDGjnMQboM) [posts](https://www.deviantart.com/littlepie95/art/Improved-Shiny-Leafeon-806020174) suggesting the idea.

![Magcargo](ShinyChanges/magcargo_shiny.png)

**Magcargo** - Lava part matches shiny Slugma.

![Mantyke](ShinyChanges/mantyke_shiny.png) ![Mantine](ShinyChanges/mantine_shiny.png)

**Mantyke, Mantine** - Green and aqua-ish scheme, based on [this](https://www.deviantart.com/rayquazaflygon/art/Alt-Shiny-Mantine-711360951) post by RayquazaFlygon.

![Phanphy](ShinyChanges/phanphy_shiny.png)

**Phanphy** - Inverted from its normal palette.

![Smoochum](ShinyChanges/smoochum_shiny.png)

**Smoochum** - Lavender and light-pink body, and platinum blonde hair to match shiny Jynx.

![Magby](ShinyChanges/magby_shiny.png)

**Magby** - Red-pink and pink to match Magmar and Magmortar's shiny colors.

![Happiny](ShinyChanges/happiny_shiny.png) ![Blissey](ShinyChanges/blissey_shiny.png)

**Happiny, Blissey** - Green and light-gold-tan to match shiny Chansey. *(The image data of Blissey's sprite has also been tweaked.)*

![Combusken](ShinyChanges/combusken_shiny.png)

**Combusken** - Changed to match the color change made in Sword/Shield.

![Loudred](ShinyChanges/loudred_shiny.png) ![Exploud](ShinyChanges/exploud_shiny.png)

**Loudred, Exploud** - Lime green details instead of yellow to match shiny Whismur.

![Plusle](ShinyChanges/plusle_shiny.png)

**Plusle** - Hot pink/magenta.

![Regice](ShinyChanges/regice_shiny.png)

**Regice** - A deep dark blue, inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandJTV/comments/ibqj33/shiny_regice_redesign_its_not_much_but_its_better/) by [/u/SmallBigBrainBoi](https://www.reddit.com/user/SmallBigBrainBoi).

![Piplup](ShinyChanges/piplup_shiny.png) ![Prinplup](ShinyChanges/prinplup_shiny.png) ![Empoleon](ShinyChanges/empoleon_shiny.png)

**Dusknoir** - Red to match shiny Duskull and Dusclops.

![Froslass](ShinyChanges/froslass_shiny.png)

**Froslass** - A rose/sakura body with a violet belt/bow.

## Building

1. Install [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
2. Install a [D compiler](https://dlang.org/download.html).
3. Download NSMB Editor. Because the latest version (as of 379) is broken with regard to decompressing overlays, I recommend [this custom version](https://nsmbhd.net/post/53582/) from MeroMero. An [older version](https://nsmbhd.net/download/353/) may work also. For Windows users, [CrystalTile2](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/) may also work.
4. Download [PokeEditor](https://github.com/turtleisaac/PokEditor/releases), extract it into the root folder of this repo, and rename folder that got extracted to `PokEditor`.
5. Open up your ROM in NSMBe (ignoring the error that comes up on load when using MeroMero's build).
6. Under "Tools/Options", select "Decompress ARM9 binary".
7. Under "ROM File Browser", select `arm9.bin`, click "Extract", and save as `arm9_hg_vanilla.bin` in the root folder of this repo.
8. In the `overlay9` folder, select `overlay9_1.bin`, click "Decompress overlay", click "Extract", and save as `overlay1_hg_vanilla.bin`. Do similarly with overlays 7, 12, 14, 63, 64, 74, 96, 97, 98, and 112 (`overlay7_hg_vanilla.bin`, `overlay12_hg_vanilla.bin`, etc.).
9. In the `root/a/0/2` folder, extract file `8` as `custom_overlay_hg_vanilla.narc`.
10. On the command line, run `./build.sh`.
11. In NSMBe, reinsert `arm9_hg_patched.bin` back into `arm9.bin`. Also, reinsert `overlay1_hg_patched.bin`, `overlay7_hg_patched.bin`, `overlay12_hg_patched.bin`, etc. back into `overlay9_1.bin`, `overlay9_7.bin`, `overlay9_12.bin`, etc. respectively. For `arm9.bin`, you may need to hit "Decompress ARM9 Binary" to correctly insert it (not sure).
12. Reinsert `custom_overlay_hg.narc` into `root/a/0/2/8`.
13. Extract `root/a/0/0/4` as `hg_pokegra.narc`.
14. For each image in the `ShinyChanges` folder, insert that image to the proper place using ["Pokemon Ds/Pic Platinum"](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/2085-pokedspic/). (Note that some Pokémon might have changes to the base sprite.)
15. Reinsert `hg_pokegra.narc` back into `root/a/0/0/4`.
16. If you want to be INSANELY thorough, extract `root/pbr/pokegra.narc` and replace each changed palette entry, and reinsert. (I think this has to do with Pokémon Battle Revolution - I doubt you really have to do this.)
17. Extract `root/a/0/8/1` as `ow_sprites.narc`.
18. Run `./pack_follow_pal.sh`.
19. Insert the resulting `ow_sprites_patched.narc` to `root/a/0/8/1`.


## How It Works

As stated, each Pokémon has its palette hue shifted by an amount determined by their personality value. To be more precise, the hue shift is currently coded to be within +/- 20 degrees, and the third personality byte, masked with `0x3F`, is used to determine it, meaning there are 64 possible steps within that range. (Though, it should be noted values `0x00` and `0x20` both mean "no shift", and realistically, the steps are granular enough to the point where two adjacent values may end up producing the same color. So, it's effectively less than 64.)

The added code used to make this work are inserted in a "synthetic overlay". An unused file in the game is hacked to load at startup, which we can replace with any code we want. Check out [this guide](https://pokehacking.com/tutorials/ramexpansion/) by Mikelan98 and Nomura for more details. I also use this space as free RAM when needed, also. A quick layout:

| Address      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x0x023C81A4-0x023C81BC` | Unused                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `0x023C81C0` | Read in `Hijack_GbaPal.s` to determine if up the call chain, it was signalled that a Pokémon's battle sprite palette is being loaded. `0x0000BEEF` if so, `0` otherwise. Also set to `0xB0C5` by `Hijack_BoxSprite1.s` to be read by `Hijack_BoxSprite2.s` when loading a palette in the PC box. |
| `0x023C81C4` | Contains the personality value of the Pokémon read by the last call to `GetPkmnData` or `GetBoxPkmnData`, as well as other hijacks that cache a personality value. Read by `Hijack_HueShift.s` and `Hijack_MiscSprite.s`.                                             |

A rundown of the code files involved:

* `hueshift.c` - Contains the function that performs a hue shift on a given palette by a value (limited through a mask with `0x3F`). The method for hue shifting was taken from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8510751/963007) but adapted to do it in fixed point since the DS does not have a floating point unit. Instead of trying to run sin/cos functions directly, I generate two tables (see `tableprinter.d`) of precomputed sin/cos values in the fixed point format I wanted. Values `0x00` through `0x1F` shift positively, while `0x20` through `0x3F` shift negatively.

* `Hijack_PersonalitySave.s` - This code is jumped to from hijacks in both GetPkmnData and GetBoxPkmnData. It just grabs the personality value of the Pokémon involved in this function call (stored conveniently as the first thing in the data block pointed to by `r0`) and puts it at `0x023C81C4` to be used by `Hijack_HueShift.s`.

* `Hijack_PersonalityStore.s` - Hijacks both `GetMonSpriteCharAndPlttNarcIdsEx` and `DP_GetMonSpriteCharAndPlttNarcIdsEx`. Normally, the `personality` field of `PokepicTemplate` is only filled when loading a Spinda's sprite. This hijack makes sure it's filled all the time so that we can easily access it later.

* `Hijack_HueShift.s` - Hijacks `PokepicManager_BufferPlttData` right during a palette load for most instances of a Pokémon's sprite. *Most* of the time, Pokémon sprites are drawn as a textured polygon for the squash/stretch effect for when they're animated. We're able to access the personality value by indexing into an array of `Pokepic` held by the `PokepicManager`, taking advantage of the fact that `Hijack_PersonalityStore.s` make sure it's always filled in each `PokepicTemplate`. The code in `hueshift.c` is then called to achieve the hue shift effect.

* `Hijack_BattleSprite.s` - Hijacks a function in overlay 7 for a Pokémon who needs to load its alternate sprite during the switchout animation. Uses the nearby `Pokepic` to grab the personality value and stores it at `0x023C81C4` and `0x0000BEEF` at `0x023C81C0` so it can be read by `Hijack_GbaPal.s`.

* `Hijack_BattleSprite2.s` - Reached during move animations. Does basically the same thing as `Hijack_BattleSprite.s`.

* `Hijack_GbaPal.s` - Reached from down the call chain after `Hijack_BattleSprite.s` or `Hijack_BattleSprite2.s`. Reads `0x023C81C0`, looking for `0x0000BEEF` to determine whether this is a Pokémon's palette being loaded. If so, grabs the personality value from `0x023C81C4` uses it to call the code in `hueshift.c`. `0x023C81C0` is then set to `0` so to ensure that this code won't run again unless this is for a Pokémon sprite.

* `Hijack_MiscSprite.s` - Hijacks inside a function used for loading the palette for Pokémon sprites in miscellaneous circumstances, like during the HM use animation and in the introduction when Professor Rowan sends out a Pokémon. Loads the personality value at `0x023C81C4` and calls the code at `hueshift.c`.

* `Hijack_BoxSprite1.s` - Hijacks inside a function in overlay 14, right before a Pokémon's palette is loaded while in the PC box. Sets `0x023C81C0` to `0xB0C5` to be read by `Hijack_BoxSprite2.s` down the call chain.

* `Hijack_BoxSprite2.s` - Hijacks inside a function used generically to load a palette form a narc file and upload it to palette RAM. If `0x023C81C0` was set to `0xB0C5`, a hue shift on the palette is performed using the personality value at `0x023C81C4`.
